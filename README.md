🍷 Predicting Wine Quality Using Linear Regression! 🚀

I'm excited to share my latest Machine Learning project:  
**"Wine Quality Prediction Web App"** 🧠✨  
Mentored by **Omkar Nallagoni**, this project uses **Linear Regression** to predict wine quality based on key chemical features.

🧪 **Key Components**:
- 🔍 Feature Selection: Flavonoids, Malic Acid, Color Intensity, Alcohol, Proline
- 🧼 Data Preprocessing and EDA
- 📈 Model Training with Scikit-learn
- 💻 Flask-based API Deployment
- 🌐 User-friendly UI with background imagery
- ⚙️ Real-time Prediction using GET requests
- 🎨 HTML + CSS interface with clean UI

🖼️ Frontend highlights:
- Responsive form-based input
- Live prediction display with Flask API
- Beautiful wine-themed background 🍇
